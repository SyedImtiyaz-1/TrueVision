## True Vision - DeepFake Detection using ML

A DeepFake Detection Web Application using Deep Learning (ResNext and LSTM), Flask, and React that predicts whether a video is FAKE or REAL along with a confidence ratio.

## System Requirements

Flexible Project but below prerequisites are recommended: 
- Python 3.10.x (Required for compatibility with provided wheel files)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Windows OS (for provided wheel files)
- Visual C++ Build Tools (for Windows)

## Project Overview
